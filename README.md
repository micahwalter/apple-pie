# Apple Pie

A good recipe for apple pie ðŸ¥§.

Every year around Thanksgiving I text my mother for her apple pie recipe. She quickly texts me back with the details and her "pro tips" which I thought the rest of the world might enjoy.

This recipe is pretty simple. The desired outcome is a nice flakey crust with a yummy fill. That's it!

## Equipment

You will need an oven and a 9" pie dish. Everything else is optional and recomended.

- 9" pie dish
- Rolling pin
- Large mixing bowl for the dough
- Large bowl for the apples
- Dough smasher thing (what are they called?)
- Measuring cups
- Measuring spoons
- Wax paper (highly recomended)
- A sharp knife
- Kitchen brush

## The Crust

Ingredients:

- 3 Cups Flower
- 1 Tsp Salt
- 1 Tsp Sugar
- 1 Cup Crisco
- 1/4 Cup Ice Water
- 1 Egg for egg wash

Directions:

Combine the flower, salt and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add the Crisco and mash together with that dough smasher thing. Slowly add the chilled water as you continue to smash the dough. Eventually you should have a somewhat dry, crumbly dough. Don't add more water because you think it's too crumbly.

Separate the dough into two big lumps for top and bottom crust. Use two pieces of wax paper to sandwich the dough on a large counter and use the rolling pin to flatten into a crust. Put one dough in a pie dish and set the other to the side.

## The Fill and Assembly

Ingredients:

- 8 Medium to large apples
- Cinnamon
- Sugar

Directions:

Peal all your apples. You can use any kind of apple you like, but I prefer the more tart baking apples. A mix of green and red can be nice for a sweet and sour approach as well. After peeling them, slice them into long chunks. Don't make them too small.

Mix some cinnamon and sugar together in a bowl. More sugar than cinnamon. It should result in a light brown color. Spread the cinnamon and sugar mix on crust before adding apples. Then add apples and sugar mix in layers until you are all out of apples.

Lay the second crust over top of the pie. Use a fork to squeeze together the two crusts around the edge of the pie plate. Cut off any excess dougg with a knife.

Wash the top crust with the egg using a kitchen brush. Poke some holes in the crust with the fork to let steam out during baking.

## Baking

Set your oven to 350F. Bake that pie for about an hour.
